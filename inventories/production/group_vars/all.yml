# Production Environment - Connection Variables
#
# Credentials are sourced from Ansible Vault (vault.yml in this directory).
# The vault file is committed to git ENCRYPTED. The vault password is NEVER
# committed - it is provided at runtime via one of:
#
#   Option 1 (file):     --vault-password-file ~/.vault_pass
#   Option 2 (env var):  ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE=~/.vault_pass
#   Option 3 (prompt):   --ask-vault-pass
#   Option 4 (CI/CD):    vault password stored in CI secrets manager
#
# See docs/credential-management.md for full setup instructions.
