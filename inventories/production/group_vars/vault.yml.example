# ANSIBLE VAULT TEMPLATE
# ============================================================
# This file shows the STRUCTURE of the vault - it is NOT the
# actual vault file. It is safe to commit because it contains
# no real credentials.
#
# To create the real vault.yml:
#   1. Copy this file:
#        cp vault.yml.example vault.yml
#   2. Replace placeholder values with real credentials
#   3. Encrypt it:
#        ansible-vault encrypt inventories/production/group_vars/vault.yml
#   4. Commit the encrypted file:
#        git add inventories/production/group_vars/vault.yml
#        git commit -m "feat(vault): add encrypted production credentials"
#
# To edit the vault later:
#        ansible-vault edit inventories/production/group_vars/vault.yml
#
# Vault password management: see docs/credential-management.md
